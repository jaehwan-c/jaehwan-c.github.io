Computer Vision, along with Natural Language Processing, is one of the most interesting fields that apply machine learning algorithms.
Here, under Computer Vision categories, several different models / processes will be presented.

<h3>Different models include:</h3>

1. [Convolutional Neural Network](https://jaehwan-c.github.io/computer%20vision/CNN) - LeCun, 1989 - 1998
2. [MLP Mixer](https://jaehwan-c.github.io/computer%20vision/MLP_Mixer) - Tolstikin, et al. , 2021
